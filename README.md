# Simple-Inventory-Management-System

Description:
In this console-based application, you'll create a basic inventory management system. This system will allow a user to manage a list of products, where each product has a name, price, and quantity in stock.

Here are the main functionalities the system should have:
1) Add a product: Prompt the user for the product name, price, and quantity, then add the product to the inventory. 
2) View all products: Display a list of all products in the inventory, along with their prices and quantities. 
3) Edit a product: Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, allow the user to update its name, price, or quantity. 
4) Delete a product: Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, remove it. 
5) Search for a product: Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, display its name, price, and quantity. If not, let the user know the product was not found. 
6) Exit: Close the application. 
For this project, you'll want to create a Product class with the appropriate properties (name, price, quantity) and methods. You'll also want to create an Inventory class which maintains a list of Product objects and provides methods for adding, deleting, and editing products.
